		<dt><h3>PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT THROUGH LEAN MANUFACTURING</h3></dt>
		<dd>The project is done while I am pursuing Diploma in Mechanical Engineering (Sandwich) Final Year. The project is all about, to improve the production by implementing various methods in the Industry. We have implemented many methods in industry and got good results. I have mentioned a few in this article.</dd>
		
		<dt><h3>ABSTRACT</h3></dt>
		<dd>The project aim is to overcome major challenges like improving efficiency, productivity and safety. Lean tools are designed to reduce Muda (Waste) in organizations and improve quality control. In other words, Lean tools seek to eliminate processes that aren't valuable. Through our project we have a chance to nullify the errors occurred and to improve productivity and quality. We had also going implement various lean tools, which had significantly improved the standards.</dd>
		
		<dt><h3>POKA YOKE</h3></dt>
		<dd><p>A Poka Yoke is the mechanism in any process that helps an equipment operator to avoid mistakes. A Stopper at the defend length, is being used as Fool proofing device. Thus, considerably reducing the working time from 217sec to 79sec respectively.</p></dd>
		<dt><h3>SORT</h3></dt>
		<dd><p>The whole space available was divided into four places P1, P2, P3, P4 ‘Maintenance', 'Production', 'Raw material and storage' and last is 'Quality and dispatch' respectively. The unwanted materials in those places were identified and red tagged and than the entry is made into red tag log book. Red tag contains action to be taken with that particular item and accordingly it is sent to storage or discarded.</p><dd>

		<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
		<ul type="square">
		<li>Through our project we are going to solve problems occurred due to the cost and misalignments of the workplace.</li>
		<li> We are going to implement various lean tools, which had significantly improved the standards.</li>
