			<p> Eyeglasses are the most common form of eyewear used to correct or improve many types of vision problems. They consist of a frame that holds 2 pieces of glass or plastic to correct refractive errors. Refractive errors can include trouble seeing far away (nearsightedness or myopia) and trouble seeing close up (farsightedness or hyperopia). They can also include blurring due to an irregularly shaped cornea (astigmatism). Eyeglasses work by adding or subtracting focusing power to the cornea and lens. </p>
