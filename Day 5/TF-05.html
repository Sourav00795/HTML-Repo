	<h1>Dandelions</h1>
	<p><b><i>Taraxacum</b></i> (/təˈræksəkəm/)<sup>[3]</sup> is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, which consists of species commonly known as <b>dandelions</b>. The scientific and hobby study of the genus is known as taraxacology.<sup>[4]</sup> The genus is native to Eurasia and North America, but the two most commonplace species worldwide, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taraxacum_officinale"><i>T. officinale</i></a> (the common dandelion) and <i>T. erythrospermum</i> (the red-seeded dandelion), were introduced from Europe into North America, where they now propagate as wildflowers.<sup>[5]</sup> Both species are edible in their entirety.<sup>[6]</sup> The common name <i>dandelion</i> (/ˈdændəlaɪ.ən/ DAN-də-ly-ən; from French <i>dent-de-lion</i> 'lion's tooth') is also given to specific members of the genus.</p>
